## Challenge 1

v1 <- "Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed."
v2 <- gsub("[[:punct:]]", "", v1)
v3 <- strsplit(v2, " ")
## v3[seq(from = 1, to = 15, by = 3)]
v4 <- matrix(data = v2, nrow = 5, ncol = 5, byrow = FALSE)
v4[seq( by = 3)]

## I am not sure why I cannot sequence v3, nor do I understand why the matrix function is not working here either. Is it a matter of the variable type?

## Challenge 2
m <- matrix(data = 1:80, nrow = 8, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE)
m
x <- m[, 2]
x
x <- m[, 3]
x
x <- m[, 6]
x
x <- m[6, ]
x
x <- m[8, ]
x

## Challenge 3

a <- array(data = 400:1, dim = c(5, 5, 4, 4))
a[1, 1, 1, 2]
a[2, 3, 2, ]
a[1:5, 1:5, 3, 3]
